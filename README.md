# Predicting Home Pricing
## by Adriana Machado

This project is focused on model deployment and dashboarding (probably in Streamlit or Flask), not so much model creation. Using the popular [Ames, Iowa Housing Dataset](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt), a model is created and then put into production with a dashboard. Much of the data cleaning was adapted from my GA bootcamp peer, [Joe Serigano's repo](https://github.com/jserigano4/predicting_home_prices_Ames_IA/blob/main/01-Data_Cleaning_EDA.ipynb) using the same dataset for a similar class project involving a Kaggle competition. 

More to come. Stay tuned...
